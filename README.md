# ITAmatrix Price Scraper

This Python script utilizes [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to scrape flight data from the [ITA Matrix - https://matrix.itasoftware.com](https://matrix.itasoftware.com) website. The scraped data is then stored in an Excel file.

## Overview
- The script uses Playwright to automate interactions with the ITA Matrix website and collect flight data.
- User inputs for origin, destination, start date, and end date are validated.
- The script iterates over a date range, fills out the ITA Matrix search form, and collects data for each date.
- The collected data is organized into pandas dataframes and saved to an Excel file with separate sheets for each date.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AviDataGeek/ITAmatrix_price_scraper
```

2. Install required libraries via pip.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the script.
```bash
python main.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to input the origin, destination, start date, and end date in the specified format.

5. Output should be saved into an Excel file named `output.xlsx`. Make sure to check the generated Excel file for the collected flight information.
